                        Sometimes it’s hard enough just sharing a restaurant
						bill. Try sharing that bill week in, week out and
						you might encounter more than a few snares. But not
						with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated
						payment system takes care of the rest. You need
						never talk money or who owes what.
